# Stable Diffusion Report

In stable diffusion, you must train two different components, the autoencoder and the diffusion model. 

* Autoencoder to compress the high resolution image into something less computationally required for generation later on. 
* Diffusion model to learnt to generate an image in the latent space from noise. 
This report goes over the history and progress of generating a non-existing image.
